# Complete Vimtutor

While `vim` is a powerful tool that enables highly efficient editing, it has
a steep learning curve. To facilitate the process of familiarization a
program called `vimtutor` is usually included along with the vim executable.

Vimtutor is nothing more than a shell script that uses vim to open up a
temporary copy of a text file containing an overview of basic commands as well as
sample text to practice editing commands as you learn them.

## Setup

If the `vim` program is not already accessible from the command line, install it
with the following command:

    sudo apt-get install vim

Vimtutor should also be accessible at this point, seek assistance from the
instructor otherwise.

## Assignment

Run the following command to start

    vimtutor

Follow the instructions in the file
