# Complete Vimtutor

While `vim` is a powerful tool that enables highly efficient editing, it has
a bit of a learning curve. To facilitate the process of familiarization a
program called `vimtutor` is usually included along with the vim executable.

Vimtutor is nothing more than a shell script that uses vim to open up a
temporary copy of a text file containing an overview of basic commands as well as
sample text to practice editing commands as you learn them.

## Setup

If the `vim` program is not already accessible from the command line, install it
with the following command:

    sudo apt-get install vim

Vimtutor should also be accessible at this point, if you attempt to start it and
see an error instead then try googling the text of the error and seeing if anybody
online has encountered the same issue. If you can't find instructions to fix the
issue seek assistance from the instructor

## Assignment

Run the following command to start:

    vimtutor

Follow the instructions in the file to practice essential vim commands. When you
have completed the exercise you can write the completed vimtutor file to your
home directory or simply demonstrate to the instructor.
