# Python Interpreter Exercises

Python is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language, as wikipedia
says. It is a sophisticated tool for directing computer hardware to perform some
action that we want, with enough conceptual abstraction so that mere mortals can
understand understand the instructions.

Installing Python puts an program on your machine that is able to read text
structured in the python syntax. If you invoke `python` from the command line
without arguments it will parse one line at a time and execute it, or it can
execute all the commands in a file known as a module.

## Setup

Install the python version 3.4 interpreter, and the bpython wrapper system.

    sudo apt-get install python3.4
    sudo apt-get install bpython

## Assignment

Run bpython and experiment with these assignments. You can save your command
history for submission through the interface.

### Use the `os.path` module to get the cwd absolute path of your current
working directory.
