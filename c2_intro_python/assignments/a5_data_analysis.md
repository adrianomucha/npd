# Data analysis project

## Introduction

According to Wikipedia, "Analysis of data is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making". The key takeaway from this definition: data analysis is a big task that requires an agile mind and sharp tools. The purpose of this final project is for you to practice, and develop confidence in the tools and programming techniques you've learned thus far, and will continue to learn. Therefore, the final project of Course 2 involves analysis of a fun, large, dynamic dataset: the "New York City Restaurant Inspection Results".

## NYC Restaurant Inspection Dataset

[Click here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j) to view the data online.

We will read through BOTH attachments from the ABOUT section in the above link.

1. Description of the dataset (.docx)
1. Data dictionary (.xlsx).

This dataset has been selected for the following reasons:

1. Its contents are relevant to people in New York (eg, all of us)
1. It has an ideal size
  * Small enough to analyze on your laptop
  * Too large to use traditional spreadsheet software
  * Few enough columns to easily learn about each one
  * Enough columns to be able to answer many cool questions
1. It can be accessed in multiple ways
  * Downloaded as one CSV
  * API
1. It is well-documented

## Final product

To receive full credit, the final version of your application must:

1. Be version controlled with Git and stored on GitHub
1. Contain a README file at the top level describing what it does
1. Authenticate using a session token
1. Obtain all data through the API
1. Answer at least 2 different questions about the data
1. Unit test at least 3 functions or methods
1. Expose the answer of at least one question in a browser using Flask

As usual, the above requirements represent the **minimum** product. If you are able, we strongly recommend that you strive to exceed these requirements.

## Intermediate products and prototyping

Although the final version of the application requires the API, exploring different questions may be easier using the downloadable dataset. As such, intermediate scripting will explore the downloadable dataset. The code you use for exploration will likely not be used in your final production application. This is normal in software development, where ideas are often tested in throw-away scripts and then finalized in code.

## Check-ins

During class, the instructor will check in with each individual or group to provide feedback and answer questions.
