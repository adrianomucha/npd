# Unit testing Flatland

## Introduction - a familiar scenario

Although your Flatland shape classes worked fine for your project, they may not work well with someone else's project. If another programmer reuses your shape class, you want to ensure each class achieves what you think it does. This is a perfect time to practice Unit testing!

## Minimum requirement for full credit

Implement a passing unit test for at least one method in each of the three shape classes
  * Use the unittest module
  * Unit tests should be in a separate test/ directory
  * They should be runnable using the nosetests command line utility

## Challenge requirements
